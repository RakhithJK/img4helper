== Testing ==

The following are different things that need testing:
    - bvx2, encrypted
    - lzss, encrypted
    - bvz2, unencrypted
    - lzss, unencrypted
    - uncompressed, unencrypted
    - uncompressed

    - Complete .img4
    - im4p, im4m, im4r
    - extracting (with the above combinations)
    - decrypting (with the above combinations)
    
    - decrypting / splitting SEPOS


TODO:
    - Cannot use '-a' and '-e' at the same time, but can when using '-k'

            NOTES ABOUT IBOOT/IBEC/IBSS/LLB:
                They aren't Mach-O's, they're plain data. To find Load Address disassemble
                from 0x0 and take the first 'LDR' instruction, e.g.:

                    ROM:000 loc_0                            
                    ROM:000                                 
                    ROM:000          ADRP     X0, #loc_0@PAGE
                    ROM:004          ADD      X0, X0, #loc_0@PAGEOFF    <=== X0 has the current page address
                    ROM:008          LDR      X1, =0x83D37B000          <=== this is the loading address
